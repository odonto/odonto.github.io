## We are made by NHS dentists for NHS dentistry.

Founded by NHS dentists, OpenOdonto CIC is a not for profit company. We think that NHS dentistry is something to be proud of. We are here to make better digital tools that help NHS dentists deliver better care.

### Why are we doing this?

Technology is changing the world and our expectations. Corporate IT NHS dental systems are lagging behind. They often prevent us from providing the care we know is important to our patients. We want all NHS dentists to see what is possible and stop just accepting what they're given regarding NHS IT. Done badly, NHS IT costs a lot and causes problems for clinicians providing care ([see this article in the guardian]( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/04/nhs-paying-millions-private-firms-block-gp-referrals-hospital)). We think by having better tools NHS dentists will provide better patient care.

One current problem is clinical leads cannot easily make changes to NHS IT systems as part of their continuous quality improvement activities. When NHS clinicians invest their ideas and knowledge into IT systems they want them to be shared with rest of the NHS to make care better for patients. We work to ensure NHS clinicians ideas are not stripped out of the NHS and made into products and then sold back to the NHS many times over to enrich shareholders.
