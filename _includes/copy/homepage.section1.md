## Who are we?

### We are made by NHS dentists for NHS dentistry.

Founded by NHS dentists, OpenOdonto CIC is a not for profit company. We think that NHS dentistry is something to be proud of. We are here to make better digital tools that help NHS dentists deliver better care.


OpenOdonto are clinicians who foster relationships with other clinicians across the NHS. We only work with professional technology partners who share our vision. We partner with universities to generate transferable knowledge and support the design and development of digital services. We talk to national policy-makers to advocate for better digital tools for NHS dentistry.


OpenOdonto is a collaborative, open source project developed with contributions from a range of hospitals, institutions, academic departments, companies and individuals. As an open source application, OpenOdonto provides a cost effective option for NHS dentistry. It cannot be sold to 3rd parties and is protected by the OpenOdonto CIC for the benefit of its users.


While it will be possible to download OpenOdonto and use it free of charge, we obviously recommend that clinical installation is handled professionally through a commercial technology partner. This commercial partner will ensure that clinical data integrates with hospital workflows and PAS systems, and that the connections to devices such as radiology and photography are robust.
