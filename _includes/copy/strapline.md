## We design and make better digital tools that help NHS dentists deliver better care.

### We work to empower NHS dentists to locally grow dental care networks fit for the digital age.

* We explore the un-met needs of patients and clinicians.
* We advocate for and help build the tools that help to meet those needs.
* We support locally grown responsive human centred dental services, and the digital tools that allow them to flourish.
