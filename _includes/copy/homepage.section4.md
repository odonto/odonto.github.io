## Build, Test, Iterate

The prototyping of digital tools is part of an agile development process which starts by developing a tool for a limited, defined, user need – starting small – which the users try out and respond to, and which can then be iterated to better solve the real unmet needs.

This process reduces risk, and makes sure we end up with services that meet the real user needs.

### Here are some things that we have done.

#### Community building and Discovery Research

OpenOdonto has allowed clinicians and admin staff from Special Care Dental services in four northern Healthcare Trusts to work with researchers from Newcastle University and health technology professionals. We have developed a deep understanding of who, why and how users care for patients in these dental services using robust research methods to identify and describe un-met needs.
We co-designed prototype solutions. This gave a deep understanding of patient, administration and clinician needs, and how these relate to the wider commissioning landscape.

This involved a process of trying, testing, and iteration through paper prototypes, passive and active wireframes of digital tools to support administrators and clinicians in Special Care Dental Services, and the filming of a video prototype.

#### Prototyping Odonto Electronic Patient Record

Odonto EPR is intuitive and fast. It is made to run in a web browser to ensure that it can be accessed wherever needed. It includes a graphical user interface organised around the dental chart, which allow input of clinical data through a series of icons that relate to dental disease.

We know that safe patient care is provided by dentists who have the information they need.

Therefore, Odonto EPR give you a summary view of each patient. This allows dentists to get an overview of the systemic and dental condition of the patient and ensures allergies and risks are clearly flagged.

Odonto EPR provides a dashboard view of your clinic. This allow you to see patients in your clinic work list and track their progress. The dashboard will also give a messaging feature whereby patient records can be tagged with notes advising on clinical state or future actions. These messages are embedded in the patient record and support clinicians to clinician communication to ensure that patients requiring urgent attention can be flagged.

#### Prototype Odonto Referral Management System

The point of entry to Special Care Dental Services is by referrals. Our discovery research clearly showed that referrals were source of significant friction and frustration for everyone in this system, including referring dentists, administrators, triaging dentists and patients. We saw considerable ([unwarranted variation](https://www.england.nhs.uk/rightcare/2017/01/04/matthew-cripps-3/) with the referral systems currently used. We aimed to make a digital tool that actively targeted this unwarranted variation and so ensured the right patient gets to the right place for the right care.
