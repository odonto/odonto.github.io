## Don’t let digital be done to you.

How can we build an environment where world-class NHS digital services flourish?
Through leadership that understands technology and is bold enough to modernise the delivery of digital services, including embracing openness.
This reflects the view of the 2016 Depart of Health report into [“Using information technology to improve the NHS”](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-information-technology-to-improve-the-nhs) by Robert Wachter.

OpenOdonto are clinicians who foster relationships with other clinicians across the NHS. We also work with professional technology partners who share our vision. We partner with universities to generate transferable knowledge and involve students in the design and development of digital services. Talking to policy-makers stimulate high level collaboration in the continuous improvement of digital solutions.

OpenOdonto understands healthcare system needs and we know how to enable users to gain knowledge that they - and we - don’t have. We’re familiar with the Information governance landscape, and we follow relevant standards and best practices - the more open the better.

### We work with local dentists and patients to identify and describe un-met needs. Then we codesign solutions.

Deep understanding of needs and robust research
Odonto discovery

Over seven months of participative design with clinicians and admin staff from Community Dental Services in four northern Healthcare Trusts, Newcastle University, and health technology professionals, OpenOdonto produced a deep understanding of patient, administration and clinician needs, and how these pertain to the technology landscape. This led to the decision to prototype the referrals system and the co-design and development of wireframe and video prototypes of the referral management system.

Build, test, iterate

We prototype digital tools. This is part of an agile development process where we start by building small, having users try those digital tools and respond to them, and then iterating to better solve the real unmet needs.
At every stage we gather feedback from NHS dentists to help keep us on the right track. This process reduces risk, and makes sure we end up with services that meet the your needs.
