## How are we doing this?

### Part of a national ecosystem of communities

OpenOdonto is a visible exemplar of national NHS digital strategy. We are a recognised NHS [Code4Health](https://code4health.org/openodonto) community. We know that making better digital tools for the NHS involves understanding people's needs and ensuring everyone can participate in their creation.

We are one of a range of Code 4Health communities who bring together anyone with a shared interest across all aspects of digital care. Communities start small and continuously improve using real experiences to inform decisions, building upon its membership, adding like-minded people who understand and can help make informed technology decisions.

OpenOdonto provides the Clinical leadership that understands technology and is bold enough to modernise the delivery of digital services by embracing openness. We build up from a deep understanding of the un-met needs of patients and clinicians. We then support the growth of responsive dental services with the digital tools that allow them to flourish. We advocate for and help build the tools that help to meet those needs.

Our approach reflects the recommendations contained in the 2016 Depart of Health report into [“Using information technology to improve the NHS”](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-information-technology-to-improve-the-nhs) by Robert Wachter.
