## Why are we doing this?

Technology is changing the world and our expectations. Corporate IT NHS dental systems are lagging behind. They often prevent us from providing the care we know is important to our patients. We want all NHS dentists to see what is possible and stop just accepting what they're given regarding NHS IT.

Done badly, NHS IT costs a lot and causes problems for clinicians providing care ([see this article in the guardian]( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/04/nhs-paying-millions-private-firms-block-gp-referrals-hospital)). We think that by having better tools NHS dentists will provide better patient care.

### Don’t let digital be done to you.

OpenOdonto understands healthcare system needs and we know how to enable users to gain knowledge that they - and we - don’t have. We’re familiar with the Information governance landscape, and we follow relevant standards and best practices - the more open the better.


### Openness and Digital NHS Dental Care.

We believe in solving NHS problems once and sharing solutions with the NHS. <br />Our ethos is to work openly.

Taking a simple view; being open -- open governance and open source -- allows effective collaboration and gives a competitive advantage in terms of the potential for lower costs and higher quality. Openness is now standard in the technology industry and in some parts of government, for example the Cabinet Office. Openness within technology stands alongside the openness found in academic culture of sharing openly what we have found through our research.
